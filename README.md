# Coding Challenge

This repository contains solutions to common coding challenges implemented in Node.js. The challenges included are:

1. **Palindrome Pairs**: This challenge involves finding pairs of strings in an array that, when concatenated, form a palindrome.

2. **Valid Parentheses**: This challenge requires determining if the parentheses in a given string are valid, meaning that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: This challenge involves finding the length of the longest subsequence in an array of integers where the elements are in strictly increasing order.

## Overview

Each challenge has its own implementation and can be run individually. The solutions are designed to be efficient and follow best coding practices.

## Instructions to Run the Solutions

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the solution file.
3. Open your terminal and run the solution using Node.js by typing: node `filename.js` in the terminal
    
    **Replace `filename.js` with the appropriate file name for the challenge you want to run.
